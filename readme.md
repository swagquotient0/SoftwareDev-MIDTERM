## Overview

In this project, we have implemented the Steering Controller for the Ackermann kinematic model. The control problem is to find the steering angle and the two wheel drive velocities, given the expected heading and velocity of the robot or vehicle. The Ackermann steering model mechanism assumes that the steering angle of the front two wheels is calculated around a common center. As the rear wheels are assumed to be fixed, the center point is assumed to be along the line drawn from the axles of the rear wheels. The angle made by the center point to the tangent of the desired trajectory gives the desired steering angle (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Phi" title="\Phi" />). And, in order to calculate the drive wheel velocities, we have to consider the displacement of each of the wheels and their respective wheel radii which is assumed to be a constant value. The main goal of this model is to ensure that the vehicle always keeps moving in the desired trajectory with proper orientation. This controller plays a greater importance in autonomous driving applications and while buiding robots which can travel on uneven terrains.

The following assumptions are made while developing this project :-
 1. All vehicle parameters are known.
 2. The initial position, orientation and velocity of the vehicle are taken as user inputs because we cannot incorporate sensor systems to get those values.
 3. Desired position, orientation and velocity of the vehicle are given by user. 
 4. Friction, Wheel slippage and actuator saturation is minimal.
 5. The initial velocity cannot be zero i.e v>0.
 6. The maximum steering angle is 45 degrees.

## Agile Iterative Process (AIP)

## Algorithm
  * The desired and current values of position, orientation and velocity are received from the user.
  * Parameters like the Look ahead distance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L_h" title="L_h" />), the Propotional (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K_p" title="K_p" />) and Derivative gain (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?K_d" title="K_d" />) are calculated.
  * Initialize the orientation error as the difference in the current and target orientation.
  * Calculate the required trajectory to achieve desired position and orientation. 
  * Calculate the position error as the difference in the current position in the trajectory and target position.
  * Calculate and steering angle and update the current position and orientation to the next set point in the trajectory.
  * Recalculate position and orientation error at the next set point in the trajectory.
  * Continue the above mentioned process till current orientation is equal to desired orientation and position error is between threshold values. 
  * Output the achieved final position and orientation. 
  * The two drive wheel velocities are calculated and given as the output.

- [x] Write Unit Test cases for testing and check the test cases to ensure all possible scenarios are covered.
- [x] Perform testing and fix defects if any.
- [x] Run cpplint and cppcheck as part of Sprint 2.
- [x] Run Valgrind to detect memory leaks. Fix all detected memory leaks.
- [x] Generate Doxygen documentation in the docs folder.
- [x] Make sure that the repository is updated with all delivarables as mentioned in the proposal.

## Discovered bugs in the code
- After attaining stability, the orientation error fluctuates between threshold values.
- Estimating the increment/decrement steps to calculate position and orientation errors at specific instants in the required trajectory was difficult. The behaviour of system changes drastically if random steps are considered. An effective way can be implemented to find out the appropriate increment/decrement steps.
- For a set of inputs, the system doesn't behave as expected. This is observed because the minimization of position error and orientation error are dependent on each other in this algorithm. If we can find a way to make them independent, stability and consistency in the behaviour of the system can be improved.

## Standard install via command-line
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Gautam-Balachandran/SoftwareDev-MIDTERM
cd <path to repository>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
Run program: 
```

## Building for code coverage 
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
This generates a index.html page in the build/coverage sub-directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.

## Working with Eclipse IDE ##

## Installation

In your Eclipse workspace directory (or create a new one), checkout the repo (and submodules)
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Gautam-Balachandran/SoftwareDev-MIDTERM
```

In your work directory, use cmake to create an Eclipse project for an [out-of-source build] of SoftwareDev-MIDTERM

```
cd ~/workspace
mkdir -p SoftwareDev-MIDTERM
cd SoftwareDev-MIDTERM
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D CMAKE_ECLIPSE_VERSION=4.7.0 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ARG1=-std=c++14 ../SoftwareDev-MIDTERM/
```

perspetive view (or Windows->Perspective->Open Perspective->C/C++).

## Google Mock
Google's framework for writing and using C++ mock classes. It can help you derive better designs of your system and write better tests.

Google Mock:

- Provides a declarative syntax for defining mocks,
- Can define partial (hybrid) mocks, which are a cross of real and mock objects,
- Handles functions of arbitrary types and overloaded functions,
- Comes with a rich set of matchers for validating function arguments,
- Uses an intuitive syntax for controlling the behavior of a mock,
- Does automatic verification of expectations (no record-and-replay needed),
- Allows arbitrary (partial) ordering constraints on function calls to be expressed,
- Lets a user extend it by defining new matchers and actions.
- Does not use exceptions, and
- Is easy to learn and use.

In our code, Googe mock was used to test the drive velocities and steering angle obtained.

## Plugins

- CppChEclipse

    To install and run cppcheck in Eclipse

    1. In Eclipse, go to Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> cppcheclipse.
    Set cppcheck binary path to "/usr/bin/cppcheck".

    2. To run CPPCheck on a project, right click on the project name in the Project Explorer 
    and choose cppcheck -> Run cppcheck.


- Google C++ Sytle

    To include and use Google C++ Style formatter in Eclipse

    1. In Eclipse, go to Window -> Preferences -> C/C++ -> Code Style -> Formatter. 
    Import [eclipse-cpp-google-style][reference-id-for-eclipse-cpp-google-style] and apply.

    2. To use Google C++ style formatter, right click on the source code or folder in 
    Project Explorer and choose Source -> Format

[reference-id-for-eclipse-cpp-google-style]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-pages/eclipse-cpp-google-style.xml

- Git

    It is possible to manage version control through Eclipse and the git plugin, but it typically requires creating another project.

## Doxygen

Doxygen is a tool used for generating software reference documentation.

To install it use 
```
sudo apt install doxygen
```
To generate doxygen documentation after installation use 
```
doxygen -g <config-file>
```
where ```<config-file>``` is the name of the configuration file that you want to create. 
In this file edit the input and output directories, and the files that have to be included or excluded while generating the Doxygen comments.
Finally, to run the Doxygen configuration file, use the following command
 ```
doxygen <config-file>
 ```
This will generate a HTML and LATEX output of the Doxygen comments inside the output directory specified in the configuration file.
